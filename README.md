# A Math Interpreter In C

This is a simple math interpreter written in C. It can evaluate simple math expressions and print the result. You can use +, -, *, and / operators. I made this just as a basic exercise to learn c.

## How to use

Running it is simple. Just have a c compiler like gcc installed and run the following command:

- Linux & Mac:

```console
gcc main.c -o main && ./main
```

- Windows:

```console
gcc main.c -o main && .\main.exe
```

You can then type in a math expression and press enter. The program will then print the result.
